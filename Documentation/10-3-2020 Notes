Tests are failing consistently
Error: "Jest encountered an unexpected token"

-This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.

    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring "node_modules".

    Here's what you can do:
     • To have some of your "node_modules" files transformed, you can specify a custom "transformIgnorePatterns" in your config.
     • If you need a custom transformation specify a "transform" option in your config.
     • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the "moduleNameMapper" config option.

    You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:
    https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html

Came across this: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/1584

Adding '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest' was not enough for me. Tests run only on empty cache once and started throwing Unexpected token errors on change. As mentioned here I also had to add transformIgnorePatterns ['<rootDir>/node_modules/'] to my jest.config.js

Full jest.config.js

module.exports = {
  moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'json', 'vue'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest',
    '.+\\.(css|styl|less|sass|scss|png|jpg|ttf|woff|woff2)$':
      'jest-transform-stub',
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx)?$': 'babel-jest'
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1'
  },
  snapshotSerializers: ['jest-serializer-vue'],
  testMatch: [
    '<rootDir>/(tests/unit/**/*.spec.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)|**/__tests__/*.(js|jsx|ts|tsx))'
  ],
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/']
};

Guess I need to have babel now too?
